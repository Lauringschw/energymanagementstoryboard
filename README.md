# Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Smart Home Energy Management System** that optimizes home energy consumption while enhancing user comfort. The system automates temperature adjustments based on user behavior and routines, utilizing AI for energy efficiency and personalization.

## Features
- **Manual Thermostat Control**: Users can manually set and adjust temperature schedules.
- **AI-Assisted Temperature Control**: The system learns from user behavior to make automatic adjustments, minimizing energy waste and enhancing convenience.
- **Energy-Saving Modes**: Users can enable energy-saving modes, where the AI optimizes energy consumption based on occupancy and environmental factors.
- **Remote Control**: The system can be controlled remotely via a smartphone app or voice assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).

## Motivation
The integration of AI in this system provides several benefits:
- **Convenience**: Reduces the need for constant manual adjustments.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimizes energy consumption based on learned user behavior.
- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual user preferences over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system offers an intuitive interface with manual and AI modes for flexible control.

## Key Screens
1. **Home Screen**: Displays current temperature and allows users to manually adjust settings.
2. **Schedule Setup**: Allows users to create daily or weekly heating/cooling schedules.
3. **AI Settings**: Provides options for enabling AI-driven adjustments and energy-saving modes.
4. **Energy Usage Reports**: Users receive real-time feedback on energy consumption and potential savings.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lauringschw/energymanagementstoryboard.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode (or your preferred IDE).
3. Install any required dependencies.
4. Build and run the project on a simulator or device.

## Usage
- Use the **manual mode** to set schedules and adjust temperatures.
- Enable **AI mode** to let the system automatically control your homeâ€™s temperature based on your routine.
- Check the **energy usage reports** to monitor and optimize energy consumption.

## Testing
User testing was conducted to compare the manual and AI-assisted versions of the system. Metrics such as learnability, flexibility, and user satisfaction were measured. Results showed increased satisfaction and ease of use with the AI-assisted mode.

## Future Enhancements
- **Voice Control**: Integrating with smart assistants for voice commands.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Use AR to visualize energy consumption in real-time within your home environment.
- **Explainability**: Improve AI transparency by showing users why certain temperature adjustments were made.
